Hello! Thank you for checking out my portfolio.

Here's an example social app modeled after BeReal. My goal was to create a light version of the product to demonstrate how I appreciate architecture and coding in mobile development. 

It utilizes:
- Clean Swift architecture
- Swift, SwiftUI, Swift Concurrency
- Unit, UI, & Integration Testing
